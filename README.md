#WAIFUWORKS LLC: AN OPEN SOURCE DREAM#
-
-Just dreaming about these really cool players in my imaginary VR game and writing free form business 
-models for what content I have created so far with the communities I am most interested in.
-
#HTML#
-
-The website so far strictly uses HTML code that I've gleaned mostly from https://www.w3schools.com. 
-They have been the best site so far with my googling problem statements for what I want the page to 
-look like and how I want it to navigate. I just want a simple site that allows for the PayPal code 
-I am able to create for free with my free PayPal business account. I can state the price for goods 
-I have for sale and create makeshift purchase pages for each product. I am only checking the website 
-functionality with strictly iOS and MacOS Ventura running only Safairi. I will check with Google 
-Chrome and a Windows build at various completion levels but I don't want to toggle between all the 
-possibilities for every single edit given I make so many single item edits.

#OPEN SOURCE RELATIONSHIPS?#
-
-I want this to remain a $0 investment project as long as I can. So far over the course of about 5 
-years I have been building my project's story and web presence. My writing has improved over the 
-course of the project and so has my quality of resources and their mangagement. I started journaling 
-on the "risque" website FetLife that gave 0 real support for building your own free web presence. 
-Then I moved to Wordpress.com that allows for free domains with fairly good templates and customization 
-for free, but if you want to make a webshop, you have to pay a monthly or yearly subscription. So 
-I gave up on that finally when I found out Github still supports simple HTML pages with free web 
-addresses on their .io domains with $0 upfront investment. I can make my own webshop, which will 
-never sell anything, and I can host it for free indefinitely while it cyber rots in this impossible 
-code hell that is already deprecated all to shit. At least I can continue to learn and build for 
-free though. Sifting throught the deprecated libraries on google search for bot functionalities 
-that I can actually comprehend and just build simple toys for myself.

#*WARNING*#
#*THIS MAY NOT BE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO READ*#

-I suppose that was what I was supposed to learn from FetLife all along; I need a computational toy 
-I can run until it breaks from my over my over stimulation and a cyber-boss I can verbally abuse as 
-well as cyber abuse with my camera that I can turn off when I please. It *is* a pretty entertaining 
-game. Whoever you guys are, you are smart about what people really want even if they themselfes 
-don't really know what they want. Thanks for letting us jerk off into oblivion at least. I didn't 
-think I would do exactly what Maynard did so long ago again; kind of an old joke I guess. But it 
-gets me by. This is what I call public journaling, by the way. We will get through this together 
-I suppose. I don't really talk this type of stuff out as much as I write myself a recipe to read 
-over and over again until I finally process it to move past my trauma. Thanks for the free disk 
-space that I won't accidentally erase and lose like I do on my personal hard disks. It may be 
-cringe, but it's my cringe. You guys have all your cringe that goes on everyday on live television, 
-why can't I have mine, on my own various text, voice, and video channels that I can decide when 
-they should be deleted?
