  <br><span style="font-size: 30px;">
       <br>  WaifuWorks LLC is an artistic, educational, and religious institution that was created for a United States branch of the Telepathic Psycho <br>Asian Waifu Buddhist Federation (TPAWBF). All data, information, and creations should be considered “as is” and hold no warranty. Any proceeds, <br>donations, investments should go towards the individual financial departments of the performers that have insofar been assembled by the enlightened <br>simp and Gizmo.
<br>
<br>These individual branches will invest capital on the tools of their respective trades, food, and housing while they work to on child and adult online <br>community building through experimental writing/research/development of content creation for the less fortunate, and educational and entertainment <br>content for other online creators, mentors, and consultants. We want to foster a habit of consensual and competent content creation that if anything <br>improves the human condition through humor, mutual understanding, and love of the game.
<br>
<br>All donations are voluntary and will not be refunded once they clear with the respective company's financial branch. WaifuWorks LLC does not transfer <br>any good or service in response to any investment to any branch of the federation, no matter how large. It is an independent LLC that creates content <br>and analysis at the sole operator's leisure and they do not align with any group, gang, or party other than the federation they have created through <br>rigorous interviews and study that should be considered proprietary and as valuable as their other intellectual assets. If you have any questions or <br>comments about WaifuWorks LLC, their artistic, educational, or religious competence to practice in this sphere, or their ability to work within the IRL <br>community towards common goals without unnecessary state mandated oversight please contact this instance <a href="sharkturtle3@icloud.com">via email</a>.</span>
