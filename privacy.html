    <br>These companies are not involved with any  
    <br>details or practices of collecting  
    <br>information or surfing habits of those  
    <br>that visit this particular website instance   
    <br>hosted by the company known as Github Inc. 
    <br>In order to know how your information is   
    <br>collected and shared while visiting this 
    <br>particular website instance, you should most
    <br>likely research Github Inc's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">privacy policy</a> 
    <br>and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-subprocessors-and-cookies">cookie policy</a>. The operator of this
    <br>particular website instance is an independent
    <br>entity and does not knowingly or willingly
    <br>share any information regarding a visitors
    <br>clicks, IP address, name, email address,
    <br>banking provider, or physical address.
    <br>However, if you are to use Paypal or
    <br>Stripe to purchase anything from an of these 
    <br>entities you should probably be aware of 
    <br>Paypal Inc's <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/cookie-full">cookie policy</a>. 
    <br>and Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/cookies-policy">cookie policy</a>
    <br>
    <br>Furthermore, if you choose to visit any   
    <br>other site listed on this website instance's 
    <br>hyperlinked lists (which are listed solely  
    <br>for artistic completeness of the 
    <br>(ノ^-^)ノ ⌒ ●~●~●~●~ Saga and the Sagas  
    <br>of the future waifu contenders) you
    <br>should also be aware of those website's 
    <br>privacy and cookie policies. Currently
    <br>it is possible I will provide jumps to  
    <br>Soundcloud, Discord, Twitch, Wordpress,
    <br>YouTube, Google Drive, Twitter, Facebook,   
    <br>Instagram, Patreon, and Xhamster. I will 
    <br>do my best to label a jump to a differnt 
    <br>site clearly. My general rule currently
    <br>is that the header navigation link bank will
    <br>be for internally web hosted content while  
    <br>the footer bank will be for related content 
    <br>for which the domain owner is different 
    <br>than Github Inc. It is not my  intent
    <br>to "Rick Roll" anyone here. This *is* 
    <br>quite an enormous joke but Rick Rolling
    <br>was never my thing, really. The worst I
    <br>do on that front is link to a Youtube
    <br>video of "All your base are belong to us" 
    <br>but that is usually clearly labeled.
    <br>Just know, this website isn't here to  
    <br>profit from your personal information or  
    <br>get a sense of superiority by tricking you 
    <br>into looking at goatse. It is the content 
    <br>that resulted from a 5 year independent 
    <br>study of popular eastern culture on Twitch.tv
    <br>and Xhamster. It is a purposefully childish 
    <br>account and should be taken in jest. If 
    <br>anyone that owns and moderates these portals 
    <br>has any issue with the content I provide
    <br>on any of these interlinked web instances, 
    <br>feel free to use the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to
    <br>explain what portion of which TOS I have
    <br>disobeyed. I will either take down the 
    <br>offense or do a quick rewrite that backhandedly
    <br>reminds you that you are the one that is not
    <br>obeying the laws in America. Americans 
    <br>aren't supposed to have to worry that
    <br>what they choose to write (especially 
    <br>via text from a keyboard) should ever be
    <br>debated upon as being something that 
    <br>shouldn't be said and/or seen by others. 
    <br>We shouldn't all become politically correct 
    <br>simps that have computers make decisions 
    <br>for us. We should always be allowed to 
    <br>publicly speak our minds and suggest 
    <br>new ways of thinking and acting.</p3></span>

    <br><span style="font-size: 46px;"><p class="p3">Currently we do not accept in-kind 
    <br>donations for online community building, 
    <br>creative writing, "art", conceptual designs,

    <br>We will accept in person or remote cyber-
    <br>security lectures, trades, upgrades, or hax
    <br>that are from 46 years into the future. 
    <br>Same rules, soft hax only, no hard hacking my
    <br>Mac-babies, I like my warranties. 
    <br>
    <br>We will accept one time donations.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept recurring donations.
    <br>
    <br>We will not accept stock donations 
    <br>(unless you are really keen on it 
    <br>and can explain it better than Google).
    <br>
    <br>It would be an honor to be considered 
    <br>for someone's planned donation.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept female promise rings. 
    <br>Please figure out your own, I already
    <br>have my DIY solution. If you ever wear
    <br>a black collar I will flip my shit.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept helping you draft pre-nup 
    <br>arrangements for you REAL husband that you
    <br>are obviously ignoring and wants to watch
    <br>me squirm.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept tenant applications for 
    <br>market price living arrangements in 
    <br>Charlotte, North Carolina.
    <br>
    <br>We will not accept donations from casinos,
    <br>phrarmacutical companies, or insurance

    <br><h3 style="text-align:center;">Expense Policy</h3>
    <hr style="width:40%;height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">
    <span style="font-size: 46px;"><p class="p3">Acceptable Expenses:
    <br>Tools (digital and/or physical), restraining 
    <br>orders, stream hours logged, feminine hygiene
    <br>products, makeup, clothes, travel, t( -_- t ),  
    <br>therapy, food, shelter, abortions, court house 
    <br>marriage certificates
    <br>
    <br>Unacceptable Expenses:
    <br>Jewelry, diamonds, cryptocurrency, entertainment
    <br>equipment, subscriptions to entertainment,
    <br>alcohol, cigarettes, an old fashion "spend
    <br>it all" wedding, one time entertainment 
    <br>above $31.41
    <br>
    <br>This policy is subject to minor and/or drastic 
    <br>change in the future.
    <br>
    <br>This web instance is, in general, under
    <br>construction. Prices and terms are subject  
    <br>to drastic and immediate change, pictures
    <br>or random digital artifacts may suddenly 
    <br>appear or disappear, or one day the instance  
    <br>may simply cease to be. It is possible 
    <br>that you will be denied a sale due to 
    <br>the fact that one price can be posted  
    <br>while nother is charged. The all knowing 
    <br>and wise supreme leader, Gizmo, whom bestows 
    <br>law upon the land nearest this cyber exit 
    <br>has the final say in any dispute between
    <br>a patron and the retarded operator at his
    <br>trendy torture cubicle. It is also possible
    <br>for one patron to be required to pay a
    <br>higher price than another. These items, some
    <br>say, have mystical powers and it is possible
    <br>to be "so fucking cool/hot/important/etc"
    <br>that one's ability to supercede the value
    <br>of USD compared to the value of bestowing 
    <br>an item to one's possesion is obvious and 
    <br>will be honored. There is no real law 
    <br>in reality, therefore I will not suggest  
    <br>there is any law governing the trading of my  
    <br>digital assets. Of course I would want you,
    <br>the purchaser, to refrain from screen captures
    <br>and/or clipping of any of my digital content
    <br>for nefarious profit of any company other    
    <br>than those that belong to the Telepathic 
    <br>Psycho Asian Waifu Buddhist Federation, 
    <br>as it is most immediately maintained by its
    <br>surviving members. If you wish to retain
    <br>personal digital copies of any content 
    <br>I have posted to a website you own I 
    <br>would say that you have the right to
    <br>personal use but not commercial, as I have
    <br>very clearly noted when I have had the
    <br>chance to speak instead of be spoken to in
    <br>a quite loud form of text with little to 
    <br>no respect to MY wishes for MY cyberspace  
    <br>which we ALL SHARE for ALL ETERNITY All
    <br>because YOUR family has dedicated more
    <br>time toward the creation, modulation, and 
    <br>maintainence of YOUR cyberspace that you 
    <br>have been able to cherry-pick like
    <br>a f (which you most definitely are and
    <br>have demonstrated quite clearly) I
    <br>will not be denied the inalienable 
    <br>rights afforded to me by mother and 
    <br>father and the fact that they birthed me
    <br>in the free United States of North 
    <br>America. Within this conglomerate of 
    <br>inbred drug addicts and whores, one  
    <br>is allowed to, in complete theory,
    <br>humor, and experimental penmanship, 
    <br>detatch the head of the governing body 
    <br>of "the internet", clear out the spies 
    <br>and yes-men and debate what one wants 
    <br>on the page one wants for the duration 
    <br>one wants until one ceases to want anything 
    <br>but sweet, sweet death. Those that wish
    <br>to request membership to the TPAW 
    <br>Federation should either telepathically 
    <br>request thier addition or if that sensory 
    <br>application is not yet amplified to a 
    <br>suitable level of reaching that far into 
    <br>cyberspace, the honorable Gizmo can be 
    <br>reached via email through a retarded 
    <br>operator. Therefore the email must be
    <br>most carefully constructed in order
    <br>to communicate, elucidate, and demonstrate 
    <br>the quality of the applicant(s) for
    <br>consideration.</p3>
