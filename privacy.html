    <br>These companies are not involved with any  
    <br>details or practices of collecting  
    <br>information or surfing habits of those  
    <br>that visit this particular website instance   
    <br>hosted by the company known as Github Inc. 
    <br>In order to know how your information is   
    <br>collected and shared while visiting this 
    <br>particular website instance, you should most
    <br>likely research Github Inc's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">privacy policy</a> 
    <br>and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-subprocessors-and-cookies">cookie policy</a>. The operator of this
    <br>particular website instance is an independent
    <br>entity and does not knowingly or willingly
    <br>share any information regarding a visitors
    <br>clicks, IP address, name, email address,
    <br>banking provider, or physical address.
    <br>However, if you are to use Paypal or
    <br>Stripe to purchase anything from an of these 
    <br>entities you should probably be aware of 
    <br>Paypal Inc's <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full">privacy policy</a> and <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/cookie-full">cookie policy</a>. 
    <br>and Stripe's <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">privacy policy>/a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/cookies-policy">cookie policy</a>
    <br>
    <br>Furthermore, if you choose to visit any   
    <br>other site listed on this website instance's 
    <br>hyperlinked lists (which are listed solely  
    <br>for artistic completeness of the Ruby Saga  
    <br>and the Sagas of the future waifu 
    <br>contenders) you should also be aware of 
    <br>those website's privacy and cookie 
    <br>policies. Currently it is possible I will  
    <br>provide jumps to Soundcloud, Discord, 
    <br>Twitch, Wordpress, YouTube, Google Drive,   
    <br>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Patreon, and 
    <br>Xhamster. I will do my best to label a jump 
    <br>to a differnt site clearly. My general 
    <br>rule currently is that the header navigation 
    <br>link bank will be for internally web hosted  
    <br>content while the footer bank will be for 
    <br>related content for which the domain 
    <br>owner is different than Github Inc. It 
    <br>is not my  intent to "Rick Roll" anyone  
    <br>here. This *is* quite an enormous joke 
    <br>but Rick Rolling was never my thing, 
    <br>really. The worst I do on that front is 
    <br>link to a Youtube video of "All your base  
    <br>are belong to us" but that is usually 
    <br>clearly labeled. Just know, this website 
    <br>isn't here to profit from your personal 
    <br>information or get a sense of superiority 
    <br>by tricking you into looking at goatse. 
    <br>It is the content that resulted from a  
    <br>5 year independent study of popular eastern 
    <br>culture on Twitch.tv and Xhamster. It is 
    <br>a purposefully childish account and should 
    <br>be taken in jest. If anyone that owns and 
    <br>moderates these portals has any issue with 
    <br>the content I provide on any of these 
    <br>interlinked web instances, feel free to 
    <br>use the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a> to explain what portion 
    <br>of which TOS I have disobeyed. I will  
    <br>either take down the offense or do a quick 
    <br>rewrite that backhandedly reminds you that 
    <br>you are the one that is not obeying the  
    <br>laws in America. Americans aren't supposed 
    <br>to have to worry that what they choose to  
    <br>write (especially via text from a keyboard)  
    <br>should ever be debated upon as being 
    <br>something that shouldn't be said and/or 
    <br>seen by others. We shouldn't all become  
    <br>politically correct simps that have  
    <br>computers make decisions for us. We should 
    <br>always be allowed to publicly speak our 
    <br>minds and suggest new ways of thinking 
    <br>and acting.
    <br>
    <br>Donation policy
    <br>
    <br>Currently we do not accept in-kind 
    <br>donations for online community building, 
    <br>creative writing, "art", conceptual designs, 
    <br>green technology vomit, etc., ect. 
    <br>We will accept in person or remote cyber-
    <br>security lectures, trades, upgrades, or hax

    <br>Same rules, soft hax only, no hard hacking my
    <br>Mac-babies, I like my warranties. 
    <br>
    <br>We will accept one time donations.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept recurring donations.
    <br>
    <br>We will not accept stock donations 
    <br>(unless you are really keen on it 
    <br>and can explain it better than Google).
    <br>
    <br>It would be an honor to be considered 
    <br>for someone's planned donation.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept female promise rings. 
    <br>Please figure out your own, I already
    <br>have my DIY solution. If you ever wear
    <br>a black collar I will flip my shit.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept helping you draft pre-nup 
    <br>arrangements for you REAL husband that you
    <br>are obviously ignoring and wants to watch
    <br>me squirm.
    <br>
    <br>We will accept tenant applications for 
    <br>market price living arrangements in 
    <br>Charlotte, North Carolina.
    <br>
    <br>We will not accept donations from casinos,
    <br>phrarmacutical companies, or insurance
    <br>companies
    <br>
    <br>This policy is subject to minor and/or 
    <br>drastic change in the future. Act now 
    <br>and you will receive a free patch
    <br>from WaifuWorks LLC
    <br>
    <br>Expense Policy
    <br>Acceptable Expenses:
    <br>Tools (digital and/or physical), restraining 
    <br>orders, stream hours logged, feminine hygiene
    <br>products, makeup, clothes, travel, t( -_- t ),  
    <br>therapy, food, shelter, abortions, court house 
    <br>marriage certificate
    <br>
    <br>Unacceptable Expenses:
    <br>Jewelry, diamonds, cryptocurrency, entertainment
    <br>equipment, subscriptions to entertainment,
    <br>alcohol, cigarettes, an old fashion "spend
    <br>it all" wedding, one time entertainment 
    <br>above $31.41

    <br>This web instance is, in general, under
    <br>construction. Prices and terms are subject  
    <br>to drastic and immediate change, pictures
    <br>or random digital artifacts may suddenly 
    <br>appear or disappear, or one day the instance  
    <br>may simply cease to be. It is possible 
    <br>that you will be denied a sale due to 
    <br>the fact that one price can be posted  
    <br>while nother is charged. The all 
    <br>knowing and wise supreme leader, Gizmo, 
    <br>whom bestows law upon the land nearest 
    <br>this cyber exit has the final say in any 
    <br>dispute between a patron and the retarded  
    <br>operator at his trendy torture cubicle. 
    <br>It is also possible for one patron to be 
    <br>required to pay a higher price than another. 
    <br>These items, some say, have mystical powers 
    <br>and it is possible to be "so fucking 
    <br>cool/hot/important/etc" that one's ability  
    <br>to supercede the value of USD compared to 
    <br>the value of bestowing an item to one's 
    <br>possesion is obvious and will be honored. 
    <br>There is no real law in reality, therefore  
    <br>I will not suggest there is any law governing  
    <br>the trading of my digital assets. Of course 
    <br>I would want you, the purchaser, to refrain  
    <br>from screen captures and/or clipping of any  
    <br>of my digital content for nefarious profit    
    <br>of any company other than those that belong  
    <br>to the Telepathic Psycho Asian Waifu Buddhist 
    <br>Federation, as it is most immediately
    <br>maintained by its surviving members. 
    <br>If you wish to retain personal digital 
    <br>copies of any content I have posted to 
    <br>a website you own I would say that you  
    <br>have the right to personal use but not 
    <br>commercial, as I have very clearly noted  
    <br>when I have had the chance to speak instead 
    <br>of be spoken to in a quite loud form of 
    <br>text with little to no respect to MY wishes 
    <br>for MY cyberspace which we ALL SHARE for 
    <br>ALL ETERNITY All because YOUR family has 
    <br>dedicated more time toward the creation, 
    <br>modulation, and maintainence of YOUR 
    <br>cyberspace that you have been able to  
    <br>cherry-pick like a f (which you most 
    <br>definitely are and have demonstrated 
    <br>quite clearly) I will not be denied 
    <br>the inalienable rights afforded to me 
    <br>by mother and father and the fact that 
    <br>they birthed me in the free United 
    <br>States of North America. Within this 
    <br>conglomerate of inbred drug addicts  
    <br>and whores, one is allowed to, in 
    <br>complete theory, humor, and experimental  
    <br>penmanship, detatch the head of the 
    <br>governing body of "the internet", clear 
    <br>out the spies and yes-men and debate what 
    <br>one wants on the page one wants for the 
    <br>duration one wants until one ceases
    <br>to want anything but sweet, sweet death.
    
    <br>Those that wish to request membership to
    <br>the TPAW Federation should either 
    <br>telepathically request thier addition or 
    <br>if that sensory application is not yet 
    <br>amplified to a suitable level of reaching 
    <br>that far into cyberspace, the honorable 
    <br>Gizmo can be reached via email through 
    <br>a retarded operator. Therefore the email  
    <br>must be most carefully constructed in  
    <br>order to communicate, elucidate, and 
    <br>demonstrate the quality of the 
    <br>applicant(s) for consideration.
