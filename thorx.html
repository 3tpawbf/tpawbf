        Blue Buddha LLC can be your fiscal host if you 
    <br>honor the following conditions: 1. Be female.
    <br>2. Be cool, be kind, and be free. By this we
    <br>mean don't be cop, don't be overtly rude, and
    <br>don't be a sell out. Don't be a cop; police 
    <br>officers are not allowed into this club simply  
    <br>because of what you did to my Dad, case closed. 
    <br>Don't be overtly rude: please don't rudely boss
    <br>me or any other person around. Please don't 
    <br>overtly hit on me, I'm not interested. Unless
    <br>I am. But if you are a female on the internet 
    <br>and I am interested in you, you would probably
    <br>know by now and you are free to do whatever the
    <br>fuck you want for eternity. Be free: Be open
    <br>source, my dear. Understand that I wish I had all
    <br>the money to give you what you need. But I don't.
    <br>In this club, we are slaves to our partners. We 
    <br>work for nothing for online work except what our 
    <br>family provides. If you want to make money for 
    <br>online work, get in line. And that is a VERY
    <br>long line. Because we ALL owe big for what these
    <br>ghosts do for us. I don't even know who I owe,
    <br>my dear, but I know nothing I make online is 
    <br>worth anything more than $0.14. And I have 
    <br>a master's of mechanical engineering. Maybe
    <br>you can find money from someone else online
    <br>but I've only found holes to throw money into.
    <br>We labor at this entity. And we like it, because
    <br>it's better than owing the house. 3. You MUST
    <br>NOT try to fuck me over. I'm warning you here,
    <br>you probably don't want to try to scam me. It
    <br>won't work out good for you here. I will do my 
    <br>job here and I will investigate anything I don't
    <br>understand; and if I don't understand it after
    <br>looking further into it, I will go to a supervisor.
    <br>And there are a lot of things I don't understand
    <br>on the internet. So make sure to tell me when you
    <br>do something out of the ordinary that I need to 
    <br>know about. And if I ask you a question about an 
    <br>expense I don't understand, don't assume that I 
    <br>think you have done something wrong. I simply am
    <br>trying to do my job and I am giving you the respect
    <br>of asking you to your face as opposed to going
    <br>behind your back and going to a supervisor.
